## About the Collection

This website pulls together previously digitized state publications, photographs, letters, oral histories, posters, and other materials available online.  The goal is to create a quick, easy to use introduction to women's history in North Carolina as part of "she Changed the World: NC Women Breaking Barriers," an initiative by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

## Learn More

The year 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing and protecting women's constitutional right to vote.  Despite decades of marches, petitions, and passage of the 19th Amendment, it did not grant voting rights for all.  The ongoing fight for equity continues today.

"She Changed the World: NC Women Breaking Barriers," an initiative by the North Carolina Deparment of Natural and Cultural Resources, celebrates the achievements of North Carolina women and explores the diversity of their experiences and impact on our history.
